# Hey there! 👋  

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an **Electronics and Communication Engineering** student with a passion for **embedded systems, IoT, and circuit design**. I love working on real-world applications that bridge hardware and software, from **PCB designing** to **firmware development**.  

## 🔧 What I Do  
- **Embedded Systems & IoT** – ESP8266, ESP32, STM32, and 8051  
- **Circuit Design & PCB Development** – Bringing hardware concepts to life  
- **Low-Level Programming** – Embedded C, C++, and Python for microcontrollers  
- **Algorithm & Optimization** – Learning Data Structures & Algorithms in C  

## 🚀 Currently Exploring  
- **Advanced Microcontrollers & RTOS** for optimized performance  
- **Signal Processing & Analog Electronics** (because understanding the math behind circuits is fun)  
- **Tech Writing & Documentation** – Open-source contributions & sharing knowledge  

## 🏆 Notable Achievements  
- 🏅 **Smart India Hackathon 24' Winner**  
- 📜 Working on **patents** related to embedded tech & IoT  
- 🔧 Built projects like **LPG monitoring systems, Alt-Azimuth trackers, and IoT-based smart meters**  

## 🎵 Outside of Tech  
- ✨ I enjoy **stargazing, sketching, and music** (*Cigarettes After Sex* hits different 🎶)  
- 🎮 Gaming enthusiast – **The Last of Us** is my all-time favorite  
- 🏛️ Trying to integrate **stoicism** into life 🤍
